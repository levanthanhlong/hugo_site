Tina is very flexible & extendable, so any Tina site may have a unique experience. As an introduction, we'll cover the out-of-the-box experience that most of our starters implement.

## Entering the CMS

When tina is initialized it creates a static build of your site, and a /admin route that allows you to edit your site's content. The static build is located at \<PublicFolder>/admin/index.html.

When this page is visited in the browser, the Tina CMS is loaded and the user is prompted to log in.\
